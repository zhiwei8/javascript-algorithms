Calculate is even number
* Description - this function will check the input number is even number or not.
* Method - It is checking whether the number is able to divide by 2 or not.
* If the number able to do so where remainder is zero. Then it should return true.
* If it doesnot able to do so. Then it should return false.

Calculate is even bitwise number
 * Description - Checking the input number is even using bitwise operator
 * Bitwise AND (&) compares the bits of the 32
 * bit binary representations of the number and
 * returns a number after comparing each bit:
 *
 * 0 & 0 -> 0
 * 0 & 1 -> 0
 * 1 & 0 -> 0
 * 1 & 1 -> 1
 *
 * For odd numbers, the last binary bit will be 1
 * and for even numbers, the last binary bit will
 * be 0.
 *
 * As the number is compared with one, all the
 * other bits except the last number will become 0. The
 * last bit will be 0 for even numbers and 1 for
 * odd numbers, which is checked with the use
 * of the equality operator.

Calculate is odd number
* Description - this function will check the input number is odd number or not.
* Method - It is checking whether the number is unable to divide by 2 or not.
* If the number able to do so where the remainder is not zero. Then it should return true.
* If it doesnot able to do so. Then it should return false.

Calculate is odd bitwise
  * Description -> Checking the input number is even using bitwise operator
  * Bitwise AND (&) compares the bits of the 32
  * bit binary representations of the number and
  * returns a number after comparing each bit:
  *
  * 0 & 0 -> 0
  * 0 & 1 -> 0
  * 1 & 0 -> 0
  * 1 & 1 -> 1
  *
  * For every odd numbers, the last binary bit will be 1
  * and for even numbers, the last binary bit will be 0.
  *
  * As the number is compared with one, all the
  * other bits except the last will become 0. The
  * last bit will be 0 for even numbers and 1 for
  * odd numbers.
